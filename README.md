Making an Virtual Voice Assistant in Python, Cause, Why Not ?

I am opening up this project for Hacktoberfest2021, add any module in the modules folder with a functionality you want to see in the Virtual Assistant. Also at the end, we will have a voting among all contributors to decide the assistant's name.


## Setup
### OS dependencies
